**Flappy Bird Clone: Python & Pygame**

---

### Description:
This project is a clone of the classic Flappy Bird game developed using Python programming language and Pygame library. Flappy Bird is a popular 2D side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.

### Requirements:
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Pygame library

### Installation:
1. Clone or download the project repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/your_username/your_project).
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Install Pygame library using pip:
    ```
    pip install pygame
    ```

### Usage:
1. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned/downloaded the project.
2. Run the game by executing the following command:
    ```
    python flappy_bird.py
    ```
3. Use the space bar to control the bird's altitude. Avoid collision with the pipes by flying through the gaps.

### Files:
